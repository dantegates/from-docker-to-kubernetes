    "If you are reading this post you likely already know the answer to this question. However we'll give a brief answer here anyway. Kubernetes is an application originally developed within Google (that has since been open sourced) for deploying containers at scale. Kubernetes has huge support from both the software community and every major cloud provider and therefore going to kubernetes as a solution for deploying containers is an obvious choice."

    "Helm was introduced to standardize how Kubernetes applications are \"packaged.\" The anology that the project uses is that Helm is to `yum` or `apt-get` as Helm charts (the data about your project that the `helm` executable consumes) are analogous to `rpm` or `deb` files.\n",

There are many moving pieces and configurations to a Kubernetes app and Helm provides a great way of encapsulating and version controlling all of these details. In this way it is a bit like `docker-compose`, i.e. a single place where you can define your configurations and coordinate services."
