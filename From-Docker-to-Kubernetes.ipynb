Kubernetes is an application originally developed within Google (that has since been open sourced) for deploying containers at scale. Kubernetes has huge support from both the software community and every major cloud provider and therefore going to kubernetes as a solution for deploying containers is an obvious choice."

There are many moving pieces and configurations to a Kubernetes app and Helm provides a great way of encapsulating and version controlling all of these details.
