There are many moving pieces and configurations to a Kubernetes app and Helm provides a great way of encapsulating and version controlling all of these details. In this way it is a bit like `docker-compose`, i.e. a single place where you can define your configurations and coordinate services."

If it returns 200 the checks are considered successful. If not, the service will continually be restarted until the check passes.
